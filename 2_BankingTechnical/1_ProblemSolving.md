### **3. How do you troubleshoot a network connectivity issue?**

**Answer:**
- **Basic Checks:**
  1. Verify physical connections (cables, switches, and routers).
  2. Check the network status on the device and ensure the adapter is enabled.

- **Testing:**
  1. Use the `ping` command to check connectivity with the gateway or target server.
  2. Use `tracert` or `traceroute` to identify where the packet loss occurs.

- **Configuration:**
